I wanted to remain as close to the paper (which was written for Gofer) as possible and so I didn't define an instance of Monad, but did my own functions (**(|-)** for bind and **result** for return)

The grammar that the parser recognizes is something like this:

    A -> charA

    A -> number<(A)>A

    A -> _

Some examples, and how they'd be parsed:

    abc3<def> --> abcdefdefdef

    pq5<a2<b>>op -> pqabbabbabbabbabbop

    3<a4<b5<c>>> -> abbbbcccccabbbbcccccabbbbccccc
